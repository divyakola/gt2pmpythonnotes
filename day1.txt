what is Programming language?
-----------------------------
	a language is a set of instructions to intend the computer or machine for performeing a one task,that language is called programming language.

levels of Programming languages:
-------------------------------
	the programming langauges can be categorized into two level's,they are

	1).Low-Level Programming languages

	2).High-Level Programming languages

Low-Level Programming languages:
--------------------------------
	any programming langauge which is under-standing processor,that type of programming languages are called Low-Level Programming languages.

	ex: Micro-Processor(8086,8085)
	    Micro-Controller(8051)


High-Level Programming languages
---------------------------------
	any programming langauge which is under-standing by human being's,that type of programming languages are called High-Level Programming languages.

	ex: C,C++,Python,Java,.Net languages(C#,ASP.Net,..),
	    PHP,Ruby,Go-Lang,shell-scripting,power-shell 	    scripting,java script,perl,modula,modula2,modula3,...

Types of High-Level Programming languages
-----------------------------------------
	the High-Level Programming languages can be categorized into 4-types,they are

	1).Procedure Oriented Programming Languages(POPL)

	2).Object Oriented Programming Languages(OOPL)

	3).Scripting Programming Languages(SPL)

	4).Modular Programming Languages(MPL)

Procedure Oriented Programming Languages(POPL):
----------------------------------------------
	any high-level programming language,which support Function's concept,that type of programming languages are called Procedure Oriented Programming Languages(POPL).

	ex: C,Python


Object Oriented Programming Languages(OOPL):
------------------------------------------
	any high-level programming language,which support OOP's concepts,that type of high-level programming languages are called Object Oriented Programming Languages(OOPL).

	OOP's mens Object Oriented Programming Principles.

	The OOP's concepts are certain rule to developing an applications.

	the OOP's concepts are
			Encapsulation
			Inheritance
			Polymorphism
			Data Abstaction

	we can developing any one application according these OOP's concepts,we will get some benefits in that application.

	the Benefits of OOP's concepts are
			security
			reusability
			Flexibility

	ex: C++,Python,Java,.Net,PHP,....


Scripting Programming Languages(SPL):
-------------------------------------
	any high-level programming langauge which support Dynamic Datatypes and Interpreter concepts,that type of high-level programming languages are called Scripting Programming Languages(SPL).

	ex: shell-scripting,python,javascript,perl,....


Modular Programming Languages(MPL):
------------------------------------
	any high-level programming language which support modules concept,that type of programming languages are called Modular Programming Languages(MPL).

	ex: modula,modula2,modula3,python

what is compiler?
-----------------
	a compiler is a predefined program,which is used to convert source-code(human-understandable format) into machine-code(machine -understandable format).

	any high-level programming language which support compiler,that type of programming languages are called compiled programming languages.

	ex: C,C++,Java,.net,....

what is Interpreter?
--------------------
	a Interpreter is a predefined program,which is used to convert source-code(human-understandable format) into machine-code(machine -understandable format).
		
	any high-level programming language which support Interpreter concept,that type of programming languages are called Interpreted languages.

	ex:shell-scripting,Python,Javascript,....

what is Garbage collector?
-------------------------
	the Garbage collector is a predefined program,to deallocate the memory space for unused/unreferenced objects automatically.

	the garbage collector supported languages are called garbage collected languages.

	ex: Java,Python,.Net,...

what is Python?
---------------
python is a General Purpose Programming Language
python is a High-Level Programming Language
python is a Multi-Paradigm
python supporting both interactive and Batch Mode

	(or)

python is a General purpose,High-level,Interactive,
Interpreted,modular,Dynamically typed,Garbage-collected,
Procedure-Oriented,Object-oriented and Scripting Programming language.
