what is algorithm?
-----------------
	an algorithm is a step-by-step process to implement the solution for the given problem

	an algorithm is a natural language

ex:
---
write an algorithm to perform the addition of two numbers?

step1: start
step2: take the inputs
step3: to perform the addition operation
step4: to return the result
step5: stop

ex2:
---
write an algorithm to check wheather given number is Even or Odd?

step1: start
step2: take the number as a input
step3: if that number is divisible by 2,
       then to print given number is Even
       otherwise to print given number is Odd
step4: stop

what is Flow-chart?
-------------------
	the graphical/pictorial representation of an algorithm,is known as a Flow-chart.

the basic flow-chart symbols are,

	oval		--> start and stop

	parallelgram	--> input and output

	Diamond		--> Decissions/conditions

	rectangle	--> Operation/process

	arrow		--> flow control


ex:
---
draw the flow chart for perform the addition operation?

	fig: addition flowchart

ex2:
---
draw the flowchart for checking given number is Even or Odd?

	fig: evenodd flowchart

what is psuedocode?
------------------
	it is a mixing of both natural language and programming language.

this psuedocode is common for all the programming languages programs.

ex:
---
write a psudocode to perform addition operation?

input: x=10,y=20
process: sum=x+y
output: sum

what is Program?
---------------
	a program is a set of instructions to intend the machine for performeing a one task.


ex:
---
write a c-program to perform addition of two numbers?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  int x=10;
  int y=20;
  int sum=x+y;
  printf(sum);
}

write a python-program to perform addition of two numbers?

x=10
y=20
sum=x+y
print(sum)


			Python
			------
what is Python?
--------------
python is a General Purpose Programming Language
python is a high-level programming language
python is a Multi-Paradigm
python supporting both interactive and Batch mode

		(or)

python is a General purpose,high-level,Interactive,
Interpreted,Modular,Dynamically typed,Garbage collected,
procedure oriented,object oriented and scripting programming
language.

history of Python:
------------------
Python was developed by the Guido Van Rossum in the year of 1991-feb-20(actually this project implementation started in the year of 1989).

the name python was derived from the Guido Van Rossum's favourite TV fun show "the complete monty python's flying circus".

he is a Dutch Programmer

currently he is working in microsoft

advantages of Python:
---------------------
1).Simple Syntax
	in python,there's no concept of ;,(),{}
	python simply follows space-indentation concept

ex: if block representation
---
	c/c++/java		python
	---------		-------
	if(condition)		if condition:
	  {				stmt_1
            stmt_1;			stmt_2
	       stmt_2;			.....
	    .....			stmt_n
	  stmt_n;
           }


2).Less Code
	python programs haveing the lesscode when comapred to other programming languages programs like c,c++,java,...

ex:
---
write a c-program to print hello world?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  printf("hello world");
}

write a java-program to print hello world?

import java.io.*;
class Test
{
  public static void main(String args[])
   {
     System.out.println("hello world");
    }
}


write a python program to print hello world?

print("hello world")

3).Dynamically typed

ex:
---
write a c-program(static typed) to perform addition operation on two different types of data?

#include<stdio.h>
main()
{
  int x=10;
  float y=2.3;
  float z=x+y;
  printf(z);
}


write a python-program(Dynamically typed) to perform addition operation on two different types of data?

x=10
y=2.3
z=x+y
print(z)
