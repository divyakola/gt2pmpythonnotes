		File-Handling
		--------------
Generally the programming languages are suitable for processing the data.

the programming languages are not suitable for storeing the data because the programming languages programs memory will be allocated in RAM.

RAM(Random Access Memory) is a volatile memory i.e., once program execution is over then automaically to errase the data from RAM or once turnoff our computer or poweroff then automaically to errase the data from RAM.

if we are not store the data permanently it is not suitable to use that data in future.

if we want to store the data permanently in a non-volatile memory for future use by using following concept's like

	Files
	Databases
	HDFS(Hadoop Distributed File System)

what is File?
-------------
a file is a named location on the disc,which is used to store the data permanently in a non-volatile memory like harddisc for future use/purpose.

the different file formates are .txt
				.csv
				.json
				.pdf
				.xml
				.xlsx
				.docs

if we want to working with files first we need to open a file.

we can open a file by calling open() of builtin's module.

at the time of open a file we need to specify the mode of that file.

	mode		description
	----		------------
	r	-->	openeing a file in read mode
			(it is by default mode)

	w	-->	openeing a file in write mode,if file 			already existed the data will be added 			in that file but to remove the 			old/existed data in that file 			otherwise to create a new file and to 			write the data into that file.

	a	-->	openeing a file in append mode,if file 			already existed the data will be added 			at the end of the previous data in 			that file otherwise to create a 			newfile and to write the data into 			that file.

	x	-->	openeing a file in exclusive creation 			mode,if file already existed the 			operation become fail otherwise to 			create new file and to write the data 			into that file.

	t	-->	openeing a file in text mode

	b	-->	openeing a file in byte mode

	+	-->	for updateing,
			to apply the multiple modes at a time.

the open() to return the file object.

the file object to provides some methods to perform the some operations on the file's.

	method		description
	------		------------
	read()		to read the entire data from the file

	read(N)		to read N-charecters from the file

	readline()	to read the line from the file

	readlines()	to read all the lines from the file

	write(s)	to write the data into the file

	writelines()	to write the multiple lines into the
			file.

	tell()		to return the current file pointer
			position.

	seek()		to change the file pointer position.

	close()		to close the file

after performeing the operations on the file next we need to close the file.

we can close the file by calling close() of file object.

	fileobj.close()

step1:
----
openeing a file

	file_obj=open(filename,mode)
	
ex:
	f1=open('sample.txt') #read and text mode

	f2=open('sample1.txt','w') #write mode

	f3=open('sample2.txt','a') #append mode

	f4=open('c:\\siva\\sample2.txt','x')
		   (or)
	f4=open('c:/siva/sample2.txt','x')

step2:
-----
to perform the operation on the file's

	fil_obj.methodname()

ex:
---
	f1.read()

	f2.write(S)

step3:
----
to close the file

	file_obj.methodname()

ex:
----
	f1.close()


ex1:
---
wap to read the data from the file?

	simple.txt
	----------
hai siva


f1=open('simple.txt')
print(f1.read())
f1.close()

	output
	-------
hai siva

ex2:
---
	simple.txt
	----------
hai siva


f1=open('simple.txt')
a=f1.read()
print(a)
print(f1.name)
print(f1.mode)
print(f1.closed)
f1.close()
print(f1.closed)

	output
	------
hai siva
simple.txt
r
False
True

ex3:
---
wap to write the data into the file by using write mode,if file already existed?

	simple.txt
	----------
hai siva


f1=open('simple.txt','w')
f1.write("hello krishna")
f1.close()

output:
	simple.txt
	----------
hello krishna

ex4:
---
wap to write the data into the file by using write mode,if file doesnot existed?

	
f1=open('simple1.txt','w')
f1.write("hello siva welcome to python world")
f1.close()

output:

	simple1.txt
	-----------
hello siva welcome to python world

ex5:
---
wap to append the data into the file by using append mode,if file already existed?

	simple.txt
	----------
hello krishna


f1=open('simple.txt','a')
f1.write("good afternoon")
f1.close()

output:

	simple.txt
	---------
hello krishnagood afternoon

ex6:
----
wap to append the data into the file by using append mode,if file doesnot existed?


f1=open('simple2.txt','a')
f1.write("good afternoon")
f1.close()

output:

	simple2.txt
	-----------
good afternoon
